# MilkyWay_2PCF
A Two-Point Correlation Function study of the local Galaxy.

This is my first github repository -- I need to come back to it and clean it up at some point.

Written primarily in cpp.  I recommend using a tree structure instead of the code here.

More information available in each subdirectory's readme file.
